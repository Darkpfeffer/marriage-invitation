# Welcome to my wedding invitation!

As the naming implies, it is the wedding invitation of mine and my fiancée’s. The first three view fits on every screen without scrolling. It is written in Hungarian because every guest of ours comes from Hungary. We planned and created all of it. She made the UI design of the application, and I built all the Frontend, and the Backend for streaming the music it plays if a visitor presses it.

## Tools I used
- Frontend
    * JavaScript
        + Framework
            + React
    * CSS
    * Hosted on Netlify
- Backend
    * Node.js
        + Framework
            + Express
    * Hosted on Render

I only used Parcel as a build tool, and React, otherwise, it doesn’t contain any other dependency.
